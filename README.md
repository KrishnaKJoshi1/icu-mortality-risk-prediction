XGBoost pipeline trained on MIMIC-III ICU data — ROC-AUC 0.90, Recall ≥ 0.85 after threshold tuning — deployed as a live Streamlit application for real-time patient risk scoring.

---

## The Question

In the intensive care unit, every hour matters. Clinicians manage dozens of patients simultaneously, and identifying which patients are at highest risk of dying — before obvious deterioration occurs — is one of the hardest challenges in critical care.

This project asks: **can structured EHR data available at admission predict in-hospital mortality with enough accuracy to support early clinical intervention?**

The answer: yes — with a recall-optimized XGBoost pipeline achieving **ROC-AUC 0.90** and **Recall ≥ 0.85** after threshold tuning.

The Streamlit interface enables:

- Patient record selection by row index
- Real-time mortality risk prediction
- Probability risk scoring (0.000 – 1.000)
- Color-coded triage classification:
  - 🟢 Low Risk — standard monitoring
  - 🟡 Moderate Risk — increase observation
  - 🔴 Elevated Risk — clinical review
  - 🔴 Critical Risk — immediate attention required

## Model Performance

| Model | Recall | ROC-AUC | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **XGBoost** | **≥ 0.85** | **0.90** | **Selected — best Recall + AUC** |
| Random Forest | lower | strong | Ensemble baseline |
| Logistic Regression | lowest | moderate | Linear baseline |

> **Why Recall?** In ICU mortality prediction, a missed high-risk patient (false negative) carries far greater clinical cost than a false alarm. Recall was chosen as the primary metric to minimize missed detections. Threshold was tuned to target Recall ≥ 0.85.

![Precision-Recall Curve](images/precision_recall_curve.png)

---

## Threshold Tuning

Default model predictions use a 0.5 cutoff. For ICU risk prediction, the decision threshold was tuned to reach a minimum Recall of **0.85**, reducing false negatives.

| Threshold | Recall | Precision | Clinical implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.50 | lower | higher | More conservative — misses more high-risk patients |
| **0.30** | **≥ 0.85** | **moderate** | **Operating point — chosen for patient safety** |
| 0.20 | highest | lower | Too many false alarms |

At threshold 0.30, the model flags the majority of high-risk patients correctly, accepting some false alarms as the clinical cost of not missing critical cases.

## Bias & Fairness Analysis

The model was audited across patient subgroups to check for performance disparities — a critical step for any clinical AI system.

In healthcare, a model that performs well on average but poorly for specific groups can lead to unequal treatment and missed high-risk patients. Two metrics were used for every group:

- **Recall** — out of all patients who actually died, how many did the model correctly flag?
- **False Negative Rate** — out of all patients who actually died, how many did the model miss?

Any group with Recall below 0.70 was flagged as a concern requiring investigation before clinical use.

### Recall by Age Group

Patients divided into 4 age bands. Older patients carry higher baseline mortality risk.

![Bias Age](images/bias_age.png)

### Recall by Gender

Model performance compared between male and female patients. A gap greater than 0.10 is considered a fairness concern.

![Bias Gender](images/bias_gender.png)

### Recall by Insurance Type

Insurance type is a proxy for socioeconomic status. If the model performs worse for Medicaid or uninsured patients, that is a serious health equity concern.

## Clinical Relevance

Early mortality risk identification supports:

- ICU triage prioritization
- Monitoring escalation decisions
- Resource allocation planning
- Critical care intervention timing

The recall-optimized modeling strategy aligns with patient-safety-focused healthcare AI deployment principles.

---

## Limitations

- Dataset sourced from a single institution (Beth Israel Deaconess, Boston) — results may not generalise to other hospital systems
- Model is intended to support clinical decision-making, not replace it
- SHAP-based interpretability was explored but excluded due to environment compatibility — planned for a future version
- Bias analysis is descriptive; formal statistical testing recommended before clinical use

---

## Future Enhancements

- Time-series ICU modeling with hourly vitals
- SHAP-based explainability integration
- Survival analysis (time-to-event modeling)
- Real-time EHR connectivity
- External validation on MIMIC-IV or eICU-CRD
